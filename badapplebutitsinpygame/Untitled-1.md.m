ND PHYSCICS LECTURE
12.06.2024


a word and its "puropse"/meaning is unseperable from the root word
ex: you cannot stop someone from visualizing "a physical chair" when you say "A chair"

origin of matter

usage of "matter" - 'physical stuff that fills the universe'

particles - issac newton: 'atoms have inertia and gravity'
waves - christiann huygens: 'light is made of of waves'

fields - used to explain electronic and magnetic forces (like a geometrical plane)
  - ex: magnetic fields
  - fields fill all of space in which they inhabit
    - maxwells theory: electric and magnetic fields have energy, tensoin, pressure and momentum.
    there also could be waves in these fields

    - "light consists of electromagnetic waves created by an oscilating electric charge"
    - however, light is also made of photons

    - Particles can be thought of as waves, and waves can be represented as particles (wave-particle duality)
      - then how can a point (particle) spread out like a wave? 
        - 'This is the only real mystery of physics'

    - Quantum field theory: fields can have waves, waves are the same thing as paricles, matter is made of atoms,etc.

    (Big square of understanding)

    fields -> waves

    forces <-   particles -> matter

        - Quantum fields use matter and force to find the thing thats causing their interaction

    Waves and particles are disturbances of fields and are (excitations) [Excited, exciting]
    Ex: 
        wave excitations: drawing your finger through water; particle excitations: dropping a rock into water

    Fields can have energy, even if it doesnt have waves (Static fields)
        - Static fields have Quantum flux, which still have energy
            - ex: the pond doesnt dissapear when you do nothing to it
    
    Kinds of fields and particles:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - bosons: 
            > gauge bosons:     gravity field, em field, photons (y) - P
                                weak bosons (W+ W- Z^0) -------------- N
                                glusons 8 bosons (g) ----------------- G
                                higgs boson (h) ---------------------- N
        - ferminons: 
            >       leptons: electron (e-) --------------------------- G
                            electon neutrino (v^e) ------------------- P
                            muon (u^0) ------------------------------- N
                            muon neutrino (v^u) ---------------------- P
                            tau (t-) --------------------------------- N
                            tau neutrino (v^t) ----------------------- P
            
            >       quarks: up quark (u) ----------------------------- G
                            down quark (d) --------------------------- P
                            charm quark (c) -------------------------- N
                            strange quark (s) ------------------------ N
                            top quark (t) ---------------------------- N
                            bottom quark (b)) ------------------------ N
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        particles in G are consituents of atoms (and molecules, ions) which are mostly made of up and down quarks and gluons
        particles in P are stable, have zero mass or tiny mass; make up most of the particles
        particles in N are unstable, very heavy and exist for fractions of existance
        antparticles: every particle has its antiparticle, but few are their own antiparticle
         - has the same mass as their matter counterparts
         - when in contact with particles, they annihate eachother and produce energy



        ##################### How much stuff is there? #####################
        Ordinary matter (4% of the universe)
            - atoms, molecules, ion

        Radiation (<<1% of energy in the universe, most particles are radiation though)
            - made of photons, neutrinos and gravitons
            - their are 10^10 photons and neutrinos for EVERY particle of matter (thats alot)

        Dark matter (25% of the energy in the universe)
            - "new", no electric charge and dont emmit/absorb light
            - not in the standard model

        Dark energy (70% of the universes energy)
            - NOT Particles
                - The energy in a static field (an empty pond)

        ##################### universe expansion and its effects on types of matter #####################
        Mater: its energy density decreases as the volume of space increases
        Radiation: The energy density decreases strongly, because the expansion causes radiation to cool
            - (redshift) and the energy of each particle is reduced
        Dark Energy: Energy density is unaffected by the expansion, the amount of dark energy increases!!

        ##################### creation, annihilation and particle decay #####################
        feynman diagrams are cool for representation
        - A negative electron going backwards in time is the same as a positive electon going forward in time
        - A particle and its "anti"-conterpart come together to annihate eachother and releases a light photons
        - particles decay into weaker particles
        - the interactions between particles can move eachother, but it can also change their identity


    antimatter
    there is no antimatter (almost)
    for every proton there are 10^10 photon and 10^10 neutrinos
        - but there are almost no antiprotons or antielectrons around
    
    because the universe was so hot, a collision of particles could create a pair creation
            - making every known paricle in the Standard Model
        Even though some particles would  decay, their number would have been replenished by a pair creation
            - because the temperature was high enough to do that (10^16 degrees)

        If there was an imbalance of matter or antimatter-all of the paricles would decay leaving only photons, 1 matter particle, and 0 antimater particles
            In the beginning there were equal numbers of leptons and antileptons[opposite lepton number] ("net lepton number" equals zero)
            and equal numbers of quarks and antiquarks ("net baryon number" equals zero)

            Leptogenesis, Baryogenesis are examples of assymetry and this imbalance

            Skharov conditions that create Leptogenesis and Baryogenesis or things that create this weird imbalance
                - the processes must involve interactions that change lepton number (L) and/or baryon number (B)
                - the processes must happen out of equilibrium
                    - takes time to equilibriate, when the universe was first expanding so fast, things couldnt equilibrate
                - most involve a violation of symmetry called CP, which relates to particles of antiparticles
                    - symmetry that relates particles and antiparticles together
            
            Where did the energy come from for our universe getting hot and converting into matter?
                - very early on, the universe had a lot of dark energy; 

                    - the expansion of the universe accelerates because of dark energy

                    about 10^100-10^120 more dark energy thats around now
                    more than the mass of all the galaxies in the observable universe
                - suddently, the dark energy got converted into thermal energy
                    - most of it ended up in particles and their thermal energy
                    - but there still is a very small amount dark energy around and mingilling with us
                        - which is why the universe is now, slowly expanding
                    - which reheated the universe after its cooling
        
        #################### Afterward ####################
        • Fields exist at all times, and can exist all in one point at the same time (Crazy !!!!!)
            - doesnt violate anything :>
        • the universe was empty before dark energy
        • time is a measure of change
