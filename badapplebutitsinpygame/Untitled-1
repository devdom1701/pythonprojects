a word and its "puropse"/meaning is unseperable from the root word
ex: you cannot stop someone from visualizing "a physical chair" when you say "A chair"

origin of matter

usage of "matter" - 'physical stuff that fills the universe'

particles - issac newton: 'atoms have inertia and gravity'
waves - christiann huygens: 'light is made of of waves'

fields - used to explain electronic and magnetic forces (like a geometrical plane)
  - ex: magnetic fields
  - fields fill all of space in which they inhabit
    - maxwells theory: electric and magnetic fields have energy, tensoin, pressure and momentum.
    there also could be waves in these fields

    - "light consists of electromagnetic waves created by an oscilating electric charge"
    - however, light is also made of photons

    - Particles can be thought of as waves, and waves can be represented as particles (wave-particle duality)
      - then how can a point (particle) spread out like a wave? 
        - 'This is the only real mystery of physics'
